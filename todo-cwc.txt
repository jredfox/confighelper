figure out why the conflicts are happening with it being in neither mod config matching the description nor id
autoconfig config around unconfigured ids
add hook into Configuration class with the autoconfig
setup crashing hooks. if mc is crashing and it's not suppose to be to dumpIds
fix crashing in general and support dedicated server side
add the advanced form of passables <id:oldClass:oldMod:newClass:newMod> people will be able to add selfconflicts that way as well as prevent unwanted conflicts
test:verify that the autoconfig fully works

future:
conflicts are in json
add support for data watchers
extend all ids original config helper did
rename to confighelper porting to 1.6.4 and 1.7.10 using mixings to edit the classes this time
