custom properties with range support and scripting
free ids appear to have gaps in them figure out why
add the advanced form of passables <id:oldClass:oldMod:newClass:newMod> people will be able to add selfconflicts that way as well as prevent unwanted conflicts
if LaunchClassLoader exists stop the memory leaks by using a dummy map

future:
add support for data watchers
extend all ids original config helper did
rename to confighelper porting to 1.6.4 and 1.7.10 using mixings to edit the classes this time
