bedrock isn't getting configured around even though it has been detected
validate whether or not all the spam of unconfigured items is accurate
add configuration hooks for autoconfig. at the end go through any missed properties
categories that require script like things startswith and ends with for tropicraft mod as an example
list of categories to increase / decrease value for broken mods
list of properties to have a range value instead of a single value for mods like Colorful blocks

add the advanced form of passables <id:oldClass:oldMod:newClass:newMod> people will be able to add selfconflicts that way as well as prevent unwanted conflicts
if LaunchClassLoader exists stop the memory leaks by using a dummy map

future:
conflicts are in json
add support for data watchers
extend all ids original config helper did
rename to confighelper porting to 1.6.4 and 1.7.10 using mixings to edit the classes this time

done:
configure around detectable unconfigured ids
