#<file.cfg or script>:<cat or script>:<property name or script>:<dataType>:<ids count>:<shift> #if a mod does weird stuff where the configured id != item id + 256 then change the shift and determine it by using bytecode viewer. note that ItemBlock ids are equal to the block id so they will have a -256 when constructing the ItemBlock but only once

Colorful_Armor.cfg:*:%sBoots%sHelm%sLeggings%sPlate:itemId:1:0#this says the same thing above it but was able to be alot more specific in case for example blocks were added to each category to for some reason
root/config:%sitem%sitems:*:itemId:1:0 #this says to do all the configuration files with item or items category and using the data type of itemId with an increment of 1
root/config:%sblocks!%sblocksAndBiomes:*:blockId:1:0 #this tells it to do all blocks category but not anything that starts with blocksAndBiomes

opperands for scripting:
%s = starts with
%e = ends with
! = not category or not opperand
* = any can be applied either to the category name or the key for the category or even the file

notes:
- concrete property: a property which has a specified name and isn't grabbed from a script example:blocks as "blocks" != %sblocks which could be anything like "blocks123"
- duplicatate concrete properties inside of configs are skipped whether it be grabbed from a script or conecrate property
- if a property is specified by either a script or otherwise it will skip the main cwc auto config loop on that property
- if using the "!" the next must be an opperand or string which cannot be "!" or "*"
- the id cound must be >= 1
- the shift must be 0 unless a mod has broken ids
- '%!:* are all forbidden characters inside of a property category
- :; are all forbidden characters of the main auto config
