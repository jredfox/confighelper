TODO:
enchantments not writing suggestions and throwing a null point exception
suggested ids are displaying minecraft for modded biome gen mutated
if multiple mods exist in one jar and one is example mod it will display example mod
logic for net.minecraft. is flawed fix it
re-format suggested file to be more friendly

After beta-1.1 test:
clean up RegistryWriter more
cachedClasses > dummy map
resourceCache > dummy map
packageManifests > dummy map
Replace LaunchClassLoader.class by using the Launch.class to not use getClassBytes() twice
implement id chunks(example:40-118) for writing free ids
since id chunks redo integer max and min value searches for dimensions/providers
convert to asm
